Enter the parameter you wish to enter between <> (for example, in <your_command_name> below,
enter the name of the command you are making) when writing your code. Copy all other code, CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER.
If you are good with Python, you can add additional code, like additional imports, where they need to go.
For <max_arguments_taken> at the bottom, if you do not know what to enter, just enter 0 and request for all input from the user directly in your code with raw_input.
If you want to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, enter "infinity" for <max_arguments_taken>.

    The most common reason to add your own command is to make a shortcut to do multiple commands.
    To run another command, type "command.Command.run_command(servers_and_threads, <command_name>)" below.
    Remember to pass in the dictionary servers_and_threads! All commands depend on it, and have it passed to them.
    If you want to write your own code that interacts with the spammer, you will have to understand how the spammer works and
    what the different functions do. All the code is modularized and somewhat commented, so it should not be too difficult. Classes are in
    the classes package, and helper functions are in the helper_functions package.
