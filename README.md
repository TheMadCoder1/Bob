# Spambot
A nice little bot that spams people you don't like.
Currently in development, developing a terminal interface and multithreading capabilities.
Not functional as of now.

I apologize for the illegibility of parts of the code. In the process of making a simple framework
to make writing new commands a very simple process that anyone can do, I had to cleverly and illegibly mess
with Python to avoid many difficult issues such as an infinite loop of module imports.

The documentation for writing new commands is contained in template.txt within the commands folder.
